# Version control: GIT & Social Coding: GitHub

## Git

Version control solves a problem that might look familiar if you’ve ever seen Word documents or Excel spreadsheets with names like `Report_2014_1.doc`, `Report_2014_2.doc`, `Report_2014_3.doc`, or `annual-budget-v17.xls`. These cumbersome names indicate how annoying it can be to track different versions of documents. Nowadays, applications like Word do sometimes offer built-in version tracking, but such features are tightly coupled to the underlying application and aren’t useful for any other document types. Many technical applications (including most websites and programming projects) require a general solution to the problem of versions.

A version control system (or VCS) provides an automatic way to track changes in software projects, giving creators the power to view previous versions of files and directories, develop speculative features without disrupting the main development, securely back up the project and its history, and collaborate easily and conveniently with others. In addition, using version control also makes deploying production websites and web applications much easier. As a result, fluency in at least one version control system is an essential component of technical sophistication This applies especially to the version control system covered in this tutorial, called Git.

Originally developed by Linux creator Linus Torvalds3 to host the Linux kernel, Git is a command-line program that is designed in the Unix tradition (which is why a familiarity with the Unix command line is an important prerequisite). Git has a combination of power, speed, and community adoption that leave it few rivals, but it can be tricky to learn, and other Git tutorials have a tendency to introduce lots of heavy theory, which can be interesting to learn but in practice is really only understood by a tiny handful of Git users.

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and Pull Requests. You’ll create your own Hello World repository and learn GitHub’s Pull Request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.

### No coding necessary
To complete this tutorial, you need a GitHub.com account and Internet access. You don’t need to know how to code, use the command line, or install Git (the version control software GitHub is built on).
